# blockchain
****PLease change the network if in case it fails to open. There is issue of IP blocker or firewall. Suggested mobile network.

We have created and identity authentication system based on blockchain technology
There is Three versions of the application-
1-	One is web app and we have hosted it on real time server.
2-	Client App - The mobile app of the same interface in android environment.
3-	Client App - Another third party mobile app for the user validation.
We have created and identity authentication system based on blockchain technology. The whole identity associated with user is inside the chain only and it has been encrypted with private key and public key pair. Public key will identify each user.
Identity Stands for – Name, Aadhaar Number, PAN card Number, License Number etc.
The whole information we can put in Block chain in encrypted form and for every user there is block and each user will be given a signature that will be unique always. And along with the signature will be converted into the QR code that will be given to the user for the certification purpose.
When the user will enter the information in the interface that have all the information that is needed to fill any form. The data is being stored in the chain in the encrypted form with the SHA256 algorithm with private key, public key pair. And after submission user will get the QR that can be further validated by the third-party app.

**********************************************Instruction to use-***********************************************************************
-While using any of the app please do not use any firewall or proxy. Rather use mobile phone network (jio, airtel etc.)

-For creating new user user the uidchian or mobileBlockchain app. Evertime you are refreshing the interface you will be able to enter the   information for the other customer and user will be getting the QR for that. Then parallely all the chain content is going to a text     file and then we are retrieving the same file by parsing in json for the validation purpose.

- The ClientInterface will be used to validate the user by the QR assigned with the every individual user. it is being used to scan the QR and dynamically it is searching in the chain that the given signature exist or not.

******************************************************************************************************************************************

The favourable points are given Below: -
-The whole identity associated with user is inside the chain only and it has been encrypted with private key and public key pair. Public key will identify each user.
-No database of user identity is required. So, chances of loss of data and data breach is negligible.
Identity Means- Name, DOB, PAN Card No, Aadhaar No, Licence number.
We can put this all in our chain for one time. And it cannot have modified later only in special cases.
And if any intruder will try to put his/her own block the chain will be broken. Because every next block is holding the hash of previous block expect the genesis block.
-We can create each block for each block and that block will have all the data in encrypted form.
-No intermediaries, Resources are required for user identity verification. We can directly create a signature for individual user after he/she submit all the information associated with himself/herself.
-Time, Money and Resources saving. No need to carry all the document all the time. Rather have the signature and yes this will also generate the QR code for every user.
-To validate the third party will be having UID verification system that we also included in it, through which one can search for the QR code or signature exist in the chain or not.  If yes then the user is verified and hence the identity will be verified.
-In UID verification after successfully detection of the signature in the chain, one can request for the corresponding detail to the main system and the request will be shown in user interface then only on user’s permission the third-party person will be accessible to the information only after that the information will be shown to the third party. The information will be sent encrypted.
-For example- one is going to a BAR to have drink, so he/she must be age of 21 thus the BAR management will be having a QR code scanner and user will show the QR then he/she will be verified, then management will request for the DOB.
Same for the bank application form. Or maybe user want to apply for the PAN or any Government Scheme. Thus, it can be used for many banks.
**We have noticed so many cases of data breach, yes, it is true our country is going toward digitalization but in parallel we are calling the cyber storm. Sometimes we see that User data has been hacked from IRCTC(e-RAILWAY), and same data is being shared with other organization and this is really not promising.
Many cases related with the user’s Aadhaar and other information breach has been encountered.
We really need such system because in upcoming days the period of digital id is coming.
-It will benefit many of those users who are not even aware of some the schemes and when the go to any centre they ask some charges although that is totally free.
-If we have given the same information on time then why do we need to fill and give the same information again and again. So this can be the innovative way to do so.
